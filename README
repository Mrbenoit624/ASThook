content. The great advantage of this tool is its modularity and the possibility

of the source code.

Many plug-ins allowing to analyze the application are already present such as :
  - The search for literals in the source code
  - Lists the set of read and write functions on the file system.
  - The search for exploitable vulnerable Intent and generation of an apk poc
  - The list of all user entry points
